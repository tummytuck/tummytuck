		<description><![CDATA[Ladies I&#039;m bothered..I made the mistake of posting my pictures(same I just posted here) on my instagram. ..I thought I&#039;d made my page private already but I guess not. Some guy followed me then sent me a private message with an expensive car picture telling me he had a job proposal for me. Then proceeded to tell me how beautiful I am and that he has an adult film co and wanted me for a scene. I of course declined and then blocked him after he said he wanted to talk and who cares if I&#039;m married. I&#039;m mad at myself now for ever posting them on there. I just went back and deleted them. Maybe they weren&#039;t appropriate — feeling guilty.]]></description>
