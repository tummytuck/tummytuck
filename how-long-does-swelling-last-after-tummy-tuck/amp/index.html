I keep patients in a binder immediately after surgery, so they control the first phase which is about four weeks. Once out of the binder, there is some rebound swelling that subsides in a week or two. The third phase lasts from two to six months.</p><p>This third phase is a slow recover time when your body re-connects tissues so that fluid in the abdominal flap can escape.The most frustrating time of the recovery is while the scar across your lower abdomen holds the fluid in the tissue like a bucket. This completely resolves during this final phase.</p><p>Thank you for your question and congratulations on your procedure! The healing from a tummy tuck is a process. In general, you will see maximum swelling in the first few weeks after surgery and then it will start to diminish gradually after the third week. By about 3 months you will be about 70% of the way there. The remaining healing and improvement will occur over the next 6 to 9 months. During this time you will notice periodic swelling, especially at the end of the day (or work out) above the incision line or mid-epigastric area which will usually be gone the next morning.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4923" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In my practice I have patients wear their compression garments for the first 6 weeks. I also do a series of lymphatic massages starting in the second week. This can be augmented with ultrasound and In Mode Body FX treatments to further the results.</p><p>I have a scar protocol to reduce the scarring to a minimum. This includes use of the Palomar Icon laser which is FDA approved for scar reduction. Good luck and be patient!</p><p>Swelling after abdominoplasty surgery can last for months.

</div><p>Following your surgeon’s post op instructions will help speed up the process, ie. wearing a compression garment, avoiding excessive prolonged activities, etc. My best advice is to be patient and allow your body to heal itself.</p><p>A Tummy tuck is possibly the most invasive cosmetic procedure and as such requires a significant amount of time to fully recover.</p><p>The majority of swelling is usually resolved by 3 months, but may take approximately one year to completely resolve. That being said, some patients experience intermittent swelling with increased activity levels for several years.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4921" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2984ce0bd9766530ee6db3180fe2b84d">

</div><p>Swelling, especially after a tummy tuck, is a normal part of the healing process. By now, you’ve likely noticed a reduction in the swelling, but the fact that some swelling is still present is not necessarily a cause for alarm. The majority of the visible swelling should continue to reduce over the next several weeks.</p><p>If you’re in pain, or your swelling seems excessive, it might be a good idea to contact your plastic surgeon. He or she knows the particulars of your surgery and can perform a physical evaluation to rule out any complications.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4920" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-df427de03e6a63b36d5a3a614ab89371">

</div><p>Swelling is a natural part of the healing process and typically lasts 2-3 months. The induration of the tissue (firm feeling) can last even longer, sometime up to 6 months or more.</p><p>Swelling takes a while to completely subside swelling beggins to come down until the third to fourth week, and about until bewteen the sixth month to a year is when you would start to see your final result. Patience is a very important factor of plastic surgery I know you are looking to see results within a week but it does take time, it is a whole process, following your indication avoiding to much activity and overall unncessary movement will prevent excess swelling, so just make sure to follow your indications correctly and you should a great outcome.</p><p>No matter what you/we do, there will invariably be some swelling that occurs in the abdominal skin following a tummy tuck.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4919" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b21d954b140adb9454616895c4a5225f">

</div><p>There are efforts that can be attempted to reduce the severity and duration, but nonetheless, you will have puffiness that takes weeks to resolve.</p><p>Provided you aren’t having a fluid collection in the layer between the subcutaneous fat and the abdominal wall muscles called a seroma, simple compression and observation are all you really need. If you plastic surgeon feels that you have developed a seroma, she or he may recommend sucking that fluid out with a needle and syringe.</p><p>The majority of the swelling after a tummy tuck generally resolves over a two to three month period of time. For most patients, there will be a dramatic change that can be seen immediately after surgery. The amount of swelling will vary from patient to patient depending on the techniques of the surgeon and the types and combination of procedures performed, as well as the inherent differences of each individual patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4918" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Swelling from a tummy tuck usually goes through 2 phases, like most cosmetic procedures. The original swelling that is noted immediately will last 2 to 3 weeks. After that initial healing time, there is residual swelling in the skin flap that can take 6 months to resolve. Those late changes are ones that you and your surgeon will notice and appreciate, but others will probably not see.</p><p>Some patients may exhibit very little swelling after surgery, while others have more swelling as related to the factors mentioned above. After the first number of weeks, up to about three months were the majority of swelling has gone, there will be subtle changes in healing and scar quality that continue over the many months ahead up to one year.</p><p>Tummy Tuck surgery, or abdominoplasty, has many options that will affect the length of swelling and recovery time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4917" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In general, most patients can expect the majority of swelling to diminish within the first 2 weeks following surgery. The remainder of swelling can take 2 or 3 months longer to dissipate.</p><p>Some factors that can affect post-abdominoplasty swelling are:</p><ul>
<li>Rectus muscle diastasis</li>
<li>repair with tummy tuck</li>
<li>Liposuction in addition to tummy tuck</li>
<li>Extent of the procedure (mini tummy tuck vs. body lift)</li>
<li>Pre-existing condition of the patient</li>
</ul><p>It is important to understand that recovery time after any procedure is a process that goes through stages, and not every patient will experience recovery the same. It has been our experience that pre-op condition/fitness of the patient, post op lymphatic massage, and supplements such as Arnica Montana and Bromelain can also significantly reduce recovery time/swelling and improve the overall experience for patients. As always, it is best to have a candid conversation with your doctor and nurse about all of these factors in order to accurately and realistically plan your schedule and recovery</p><p>Swelling after tummy tuck surgery can last for several months – all the lymphatic channels in the front of the body are disrupted during tummy tuck surgery – so the reshaped and tightened tummy can retain swelling for a long period of time until lymphatic drainage is re-established.</p><p>It typically takes six months for all of the swelling to disappear following a tummy tuck.  Approximately 80% of the swelling is gone by 8 weeks.  For patients that have a history of substantial weight loss, the swelling may persist longer.  Although the swelling takes time to resolve, the dramatic improvements in appearance are immediately apparent following surgery.</p><p>Abdominoplasty is a voluminous surgical intervention whose purpose is to improve the appearance in the abdominal region. During the operation, the doctor not only cuts out excess skin, but also sews the muscles of the press. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid damage to the lymphatic canals, that is, swelling after abdominoplasty is a natural process.</p><p>The complete restoration of the body depends on the scope of the surgeon’s work, the features of the scarring of the skin and the fulfillment of all conditions of the postoperative period. According to the results of medical statistics, it lasts from several weeks to six months.</p><h3>Swelling after abdominoplasty: causes.</h3><p>In the course of the operation, the specialist makes incisions around the navel and a large incision above the pubic bone. The surgeon pulls the skin down, and then cuts off the excess part. This often requires tightening and stitching of weakened muscle fibers. Injury of tissues leads to the fact that in the operated zone lymph accumulates, which forms a swelling of the abdomen after abdominoplasty.</p><p>In the first few days after the abdominoplasty swelling is observed in all patients. Its magnitude and rate of decline are related to the following factors:</p><ul>
<li>general state of health;</li>
<li>Work of the immune system;</li>
<li>Complexity of the procedure;</li>
<li>Implementation of recommendations during recovery period.</li>
</ul><h3>Swelling after abdominoplasty: how to accelerate the healing?</h3><p>When the swelling will subside after abdominoplasty? The answer to this question largely depends on the behavior of patients during the recovery period.</p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>. Great importance is the position of the trunk during sleep and rest. Experts explain that in a horizontal position, lymph is easier to circulate in the region of the incision. Therefore, in the morning, swelling after abdominoplasty is much less than in the evening. Recovery will accelerate if you sleep on an orthopedic mattress and pillow after surgery. The ideal posture – lying on the back with arms outstretched along the trunk and a roller under the knees.</p><p><strong>Food</strong>. Women should carefully monitor the volume of liquid drunk. Clean water is extremely useful, but even its consumption should be limited. Remember, that thirst intensifies after salty and spicy dishes, and also after sweet drinks.
