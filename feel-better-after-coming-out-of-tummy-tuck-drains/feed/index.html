		<description><![CDATA[Wow I can&#039;t believe it has been 6 weeks already today. I vaguely remember being at home for 2 weeks and sleeping in a recliner and trying to get used to and hiding my tummy tuck drains when I would get dressed or getting so exhausted just doing the simple things like going to the bathroom or trying to take a shower. Just a heads up to the ladies who are just going through the post op journey...it does get better but it does take time so you will need to have patience. I am still swollen and my hips still hurt daily from the lipo and I am still in my compression garment basically 24/7 but to me when I take my garment off and look in the mirror, I see my results are so worth it and I look forward to them getting even better with time....]]></description>
