Even for my own family there are times when you have to choose someone to perform your surgery. Remember that there are many factors to consider.</p><p>First and foremost make sure you are comparing apples to apples – make sure your surgeon is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>Also, nowadays we have to maintain our certification. So make sure they are participating in the Maintenance of Certification program.</p><p>Beyond that ask for referrals from your family physician, gynecologist, friends, neighbors, family members, etc.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9012" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In your community that should narrow your choices down to about 2-3 surgeons that are well respected. Then consult with each one to see if you can build a good rapport with them. See if they make themselves available to you for questions, etc.</p><p>If you have a great surgeon but can never see them and only see their assistant, then you really don’t have a great surgeon. After a certain number of times a surgeon performs a procedure the quantity is no longer important. Quality is also very important.</p><p>Some who are overbooking and go from one surgery to another are not necessarily going to give you the same quailty as someon who can give you their full attention.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9013" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Mistakes are made more often in a hectic environment. Therefore, quantity of surgeries they have done is only one factor among many to consider. Look for quality as well. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic Surgeon Search</h3><p>What you need to do is find a board certified plastic surgeon. Then you need to go for a consultation and get the feel of the surgeon. Next you need to look at the before and after photos. One you have done all this, you take a step back and evaluate the surgeon on all the aspects. If you were pleased with all of it, then you have found your surgeon. Quantity is not quality! (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Number of procedures done by doctors tell success most of the time</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9014" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most of the time. Plastic surgeons are SUPER specialists. All of us had to train in another surgical field before beginning training in Plastic Surgery. As such, just like it does not take a seasoned guitar player or piano player to pick up and play a tune – it does not take a long time for a plastic surgery resident to learn how to perform a procedure adequately.</p><p>But – like other surgical disciplines, Plastic Surgery depends on developing judgment and unlike other surgical fields there is a unique sense of artistry and navigating various algorithms of choices. The last two DO take time and experience to develop. While on the whole, the more times you do a procedure, the better, at some point it does not really make a difference. The question remains, how do the results look? are the patients happy? AND – these questions will reflect that surgeon’s judgments as it interacts with experience.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9011" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Now, a personal advice. I think that operating on a patient creates a special bond between doctor and plastic surgery patient. Someone trusts us with her life and future appearance something no woman entrust her husband when she marries him. So – forget the numbers for a second – did he/she do hundreds or thousands of those cases? The REAL question is what does your GUT tell you? Do you trust your plastic surgeon or not? If you do not, it does NOT make a difference how many cases he/she did or does? If you do, get over your fears and doubt! Ultimately, this is like getting married; you have done your rationale research, if you subjective gut feeling is telling you “this is right” then go with it. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery and numbers of cases</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9010" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You would best be treated by someone who is “seasoned” however it doesn’t mean that the surgeon has to have done thousands of the type of procedure you want. Quantity doesn’t always equate with quality. (Steven Wallach, MD, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Does Number of Procedures Equal Success</h3><p>You certainly want to have an experienced plastic surgeon. However, someone who has performed a procedure 500 times is not necessarily going to obtain a better result than one who has done the procedure 100 times. Seek a Board-certified surgeon who is a member of ASAPS. Ask to see photos and to speak with others who have undergone the procedure. Do not be afraid to seek a second or even a third opinion. (John Whitt, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9009" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Here is my opinion based on my life experience. Quantity is important as the young doctor overcomes the learning curve and develops his skill. Numbers are important to keep the edge as well. However, I have seen that no matter how many times a procedure is done, some doctors never seem to get a good result. This may result in a lack of skill, patience, a critical aesthetic eye, or lack of passion for our profession.</p><p>On the other hand, I have also seen the converse where a neophyte comes in and does great right out of residency. So the best thing to do is to look at the doctor’s work, training, credentials, talk to patients, and go with your gut on how you feel the doctor will perform for you. Sometims a sub – optimal result will occur, and ask your doctor how he handles it. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, Harrisburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgeons expertise</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9015" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Although all board certified plastic surgeons have the basic education their experiences and talets vary. Generally speaking the more of something that someone does, the better they should get at it.</p><p>This is especially true in the free enterprise system because if they are not doing a good job people would not go to them and therefor they would have less patients.</p><p>So if you have someone who does the moat breast augmentations (or other specific procedure) they are probably pretty good at it. (John P. Stratis, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Multiple procedures and expertise</h3><p>The number of times a plastic surgeon does a tummy tuck, breast lift and implants, all three together in one year may be far less than any of these procedures individually. What is important is: is your physician a board certified plastic surgeon? how long has he been in practice? how often has he done any of these procedures (together or separately)? Can you see pictures of patients and talk with patients who have had the procedure? Of course if he/she only does one or two of these individual procedures per year then you might be concerned, but these procedures are the “bread and butter” of plastic surgeons. If you have concerns, then get a second opinion and go with your gut feelings for the surgeon you feel the most comfortable with. (Theodore Katz, MD, FACS)</p></div>
