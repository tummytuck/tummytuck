</div>To make surgery affordable for you, we offer many financing plans. Most health insurance plans will not cover cosmetic tummy tuck surgery, related complications or another surgery to revise the appearance of your body.
<p>We also offer Cosmetassure to all of our patients. CosmetAssure is an affordable insurance for elective surgery to mitigate financial burden in the unlikely event of a complication arising after elective aesthetic surgery.</p><p>The best way to know the actual <a title="Tummy tuck cost" href="../../tummy-tuck-cost/index.html" target="_blank">cost of your tummy tuck</a> is to consult a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons.</p><p></p>

</div>When cosmetic surgery is performed, the overall cost is normally divided in a few different components. For a tummy tuck, there is a charge for the surgeon to perform the operation, there is another charge to use the operating room facility, and a third charge for the anesthesiologist. Nationwide, the average surgeon charge for a tummy tuck is $5,278. This however, does not include the use of
<p>the operating facility and the anesthesiologist. The cost for a tummy tuck varies across the country. An overall package price for an abdominoplasty could run anywhere from $4,800 to $15,000.</p><p>When considering any type of cosmetic surgery, it is very important to not only research the background of the doctor performing it but to also research the accreditation of the facility in which the operation is to be performed. </p><p></p>

</div>It is important to know that the facility is properly accredited and licensed for the type of procedure being offered there.  It is also important to know the background of the anesthesiologist. Some facilities utilize nurse anesthetists and other facilities utilize M.D. anesthesiologists.
<p>Overall prices for a tummy tuck can vary anywhere between $4,800 to over $15,000. When considering any type of surgical procedure it is important to know exactly what you are getting for your money.</p><h3>Top answers of plastic surgeons how much is tummy tuck</h3><ul>
<li>There are many types of tummy tucks each taking different amounts of time.  A full tummy tuck is much more involved compared to a mini-tummy tuck.  Some patients also need alot of liposuction in conjunction with the abdominoplasty.  A full consultation is necessary to determine the exact cost.  The cost ranges from $7500-9000.</li>
<li>The cost of a tummy tuck can range from $4000 to $9000 and varies with local market and practice. I practice in the Miami market and our current price is about $5500. This includes anesthesia, surgery, operating room costs, and post-surgery care.</li>
<li>The price of a tummy tuck varies greatly. Anywhere from $5000 to $10000 depending on the region of the country and the surgeon. Do your research and know what questions to ask. A high priced tummy tuck may look no better than a very low cost one but make sure your surgeon is board certified and has photos to show you along with doing a lot of surgery.</li>
<li>Tummy tuck prices vary by region and surgeon. In my practice in 2010 a typical tummy tuck costs between $7,500 and $9,000, including all costs (surgeon fees, anesthesia, and surgery center).</li>

</div>
<li>Tummy tucks range from $5000 to $9000. It depends on the extent of surgery and the time involved. I would not shop based on price. This is a serious procedure and you don’t want the K-mart of plastic surgery. On the other hand the most expensive surgeon, is not necessarily the best. You should be fully evaluated by a board-certified plastic surgeon. Look for the American Board of Plastic Surgery certification. Check his/her before and after photos of his/her actual patients.</li>
<li>In San Francisco office most abdominoplasties cost between $6500 and $9500. This includes hospital and anesthesia fees. I would encourage you to becareful in terms of “shopping” for plastic surgery based on price alone. Be sure you’re dealing with a board certified plastic surgeon who is able to describe in detail the risks, benefits and alternatives to an abdominoplasty. Remember, this is a serious surgery and nothing is more important than your health.</li>
<li>In Southern California towns of Beverly Hills and Los Angeles tummy tuck prices vary from $6500 to $16000 depeding of the type of tummy tuck, such as abdominoplasty, body lift, etc. It also depedins on the patient size and the amount of work involved for a tummy tuck. Finally, different plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills have different charges depending on thier experties and/or place of work.</li>
<li>The cost for a tummy tuck practice varies. I have 3 different prices depending on the extent of the operation. Some patients need a small tummy tuck which takes less time then a large tummy tuck so due to that case a small tummy tuck is less then a moderate or large. The cost ranges anywhere from $5100 – 8000.</li>

</div>
<li>Costs vary by region of the country and what is involved.  San Antonio Tummy Tuck prices vary based on surgeon’s experience and where they do your surgery.  I would suggest that you visit several plastic surgeons in your area and get price quotes from all of them.  I would not worry about a few hundred dollars difference.  Also keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Choose the Board Certified Plastic Surgeon that you are most comfortable with.</li>
<li>The standard charge for a tummy tuck is $7000. This price includes the cost of anesthesia and operating room charges.  While some procedures require more time and have a slightly higher price, those that are less time consuming will also have a slightly lower price.</li>
<li>As you can see the price of a tummy tuck will vary significantly with your geographic location and need for ancillary procedures such as liposuction.  In my practice, a standard “full tummy tuck” runs between $6000 and $7000 depending on the need for an overnight stay.  Use of a pain pump postoperatively can allow the patient to go home and save the overnight fee, but this does add about $500 to the cost.  Many times there are some areas that would benefit from liposuction at the same time as tummy tuck so that can increase the total cost as well.</li>
<li>The price for a tummy tuck can vary from patient to patient depending on how extensive the surgery is.  The range is usually between 9K – 15K.  The most important questions to ask upon receiving your quote are to confirm that the facility, anesthesia and follow up visits are included and there are no hidden costs that may pop up later.</li>
<li>The cost of any surgery varies so much around the country that it would not be possible to give you a very good answer. But all you need to do is call the offices of plastic surgeons in your area and you will be able to get an answer that will apply to your state and area.</li>
<li>I charge $5500 for a tummy tuck (for a patient of average size).  This is a full tummy tuck, not a “mini.”  The price includes anesthesia and the surgery center.  Follow-up visits are included. I often perform liposuction simultaneously.  Most patients benefit from both the tummy tuck and liposuction.  The liposuction adds $2000-4000, depending on the areas treated. You will see a large range in prices.  We can be cost competitive because we have our own surgery center on site, which also has a number of advantages in terms of sterility, convenience, scheduling, and control of staffing.  It allows us to tailor the anesthesia to the needs of the cosmetic surgery patient, which is important.  We also do a high volume of this type of surgery.</li>
