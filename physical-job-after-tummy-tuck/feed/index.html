		<description><![CDATA[My two cents:
Always remember that all of our plastic surgery experiences will be different.
Recovery depends on:
**Your overall health
**Genetics (how your scar may heal)
**Your doctor&#039;s surgery training, skills and techniques
**How much skin/fat is removed
**If you follow your doctor&#039;s orders 
**Age - some of us bounce back better when we&#039;re younger 
Etc etc etc, I could go on.
My point is to not assume that one person&#039;s experience will be yours.
Ask, listen and process people&#039;s advice and suggestions as YOU see fit. As well, remember to also do your own leg work to ensure you make the best choice for you.
Sending with warm regards!]]></description>
