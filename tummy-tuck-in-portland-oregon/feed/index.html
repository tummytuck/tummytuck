		<description><![CDATA[To tonight I wrapped my arms around my 11 year old.. And from Habit picked her up .. You know what? That child is 65 lbs and I lifted her .. No pain, no nothing .. She didn&#039;t come the ground just up to her toes .. But still .. I think I have been too easy on me .. Time to step up and move into the next step of working out ..]]></description>
