Kaczynski, MD Reviews:</b></p><p><strong>– Anna Rodacker</strong><br>
I met Dr. Kaczynski about 10 years ago. It was a time in my life where my body was changing and I knew that no matter how much I exercised it was not going to be enough! I went in for a consultation and left feeling reassured about my decision to have surgery. Dr. Kaczynski is a very meticulous and caring surgeon. His attention to detail in sculpting my body was incredible. I have received numerous compliments on how I looked then and still do now 10 years later! I recently went to see him and had some maintenance work done…again the results were amazing. He knows how to keep your body looking “refreshed” and not over done. I have recommended him to family and friends and they have all loved their results. If your looking for a trustworthy physician that can perform what he says he can/will do… He’s the one you should see!</p><p><strong>– Gen Finegan</strong><br>
Amazing Doctor with a fabulous staff. He is a classy professional that does beautiful tasteful work. I’m so happy I found him.</p><p><strong>– Jesica Sanders</strong><br>
Couldn’t be happier with the procedure, the doctor, or the staff! I am so pleased with how it has turned out! I looked at LOTS of different doctors and turned down cheaper options and even a ‘free’ (insurance) option in order to get Dr. K to do my procedure! So so so happy!</p><p><strong>– Natalie Dettling</strong><br>
Dr. Kazinski and his team were fabulous. He accurately explained what to expect on the day of surgery and recovery. I was immediately at ease on the morning of surgery and the recovery was exactly as planned. I was back to work 2 days later with very little discomfort. Not once did I have to take pain medication. I was immediately pleased with the results and continue to be, as the swelling lessens and healing progresses. I would do it again. I only wish that I hadn’t waited so long to get the Laser Lipo done!</p><p><strong>– Mark T</strong><br>
I found Advanced concepts in Plastic Surgery after searching several major metro areas. I travel for work and had the opportunity to select from many surgeons. It was rather convenient that my choice was from my home town. It wasn’t that it was close to home, it was a combination of several things. From the very first consultation I was beyong comfortable, Dr. Kaczynski was very professional and addressed my concerns as well as understood the emotional side of why I was there. The staff was very respectful of my privacy and my needs. They promptly adressed my concerns throughout the process of the procedure and the follow up. Having a procedure is VERY personal to the patient and I felt as if Dr. Kaczynski put this first, before anything we discussed we adressed my feelings and how I ended up in his office… I was comfortable with him and placed my vanity in the hands of his expertise. Dr. K and his staff have earned my trust and satisfied my very demanding needs..! Highly recommended..!</p><p>– After making the decision to have plastic surgery, My physician referred me to Dr. Kaczynski. This was one of the best decisions of my life. I have had excellent results. It has been a pleasure working with Dr. Kaczynski and his staff. He is professional, skilled and caring. I do not hesitate to recommend him to anyone interested in plastic surgery.</p><p>– Dr. Kaczynski is just truly an artist. At 60 years of age, he sculpted my body into that of a 25 year old. I now proudly wear a bikini, which I haven’t done in years. He is kind, caring and his post surgery care is far and away better than any I have seen before.</p><p>-I thought about a breast reduction/breast lift for a long time before consulting a physician. I finally pursued the idea when several friends recommended the same doctor, and that doctor was Andrew Kaczynski. From the intake stage through the recovery stage, Dr. Kaczynski and his office staff have been helpful</p><p>– I am 100% satisfied with the Lipo-sculpture of head, neck and mini cheek lift that refreshes my whole body. Searching many outstanding Board Certified Plastic Surgeons on recent web sites & testimonials, I selected Andrew Kaczynski, M.D. due to comparing education, clinical positions held, recent skills added to the best in former times. His charming personality, great sense of humor, add a lot of ease . Already knowing his expertise of skilled results as a returning patient, my records are available for review in his successful long time office building. With new advances in body sculpting & contouring 2013 is a great year to choose his offering not available a few years ago too. Unique individual needs were reviewed on consult with Andrew Kaczynski, M.D. , he responded with the exact needed procedure to get results. Directions were laid out verbally, in print & easily followed by me. He put me at ease and all his skilled, smart staff was supportive throughout. Small pain.</p><p>– Dr K and his staff are exceptional. Have had Phaser HyDef done for both me and my husband and breast Implants a few years before that. I have also sent at least a dozen friends to Dr K and everyone is thrilled with him and his office. Very professional and a true artist eye. I whole heartedly recommend him.</p><p>– Dr. K is amazing I had lost 130 pounds when I first met Dr. K. I had an arm lift in July of 2011 and not only did he do a great job I was back to work in 2 1/2 weeks. Six months later I had so much skin hanging over my knees from the weight loss I went back to see Dr. K again and he did another incredible job on my legs. I was only off work for 2 1/2 weeks, and only took pain pill for a few days. I started running 5k’s and found that I would get rashes under my stomach from the hanging skin. I had never planned a tummy tuck because I had heard how much they hurt and how long you had to be off work. I enjoyed running so much I called on Dr. K again to help me out with this. To my surprise the surgery went so well. I had it done on June 5th; my drains out on the 7th and took my last pain pill on the 7th. I was walking up right and doing remarkable. I got my stiches out a week later, and was picking blue berries that afternoon. I can’t say enough about Dr. K and his staff.</p><p>– Anna Rodacker ★★★★★<br>
