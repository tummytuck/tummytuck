		<description><![CDATA[I am surprised you were advised to stop wearing your garment so soon, its an important part of your tissue and skin healing I would advise a to wear a garment min 6 wks post tummy tuck op, you may find that after the first 4 wks you will want to wear a smaller size garment  this is good news of course! It depends on how adjustable the garment you have is. You can move on to a 2nd stage garment in the later weeks, for many people this is for returning to work and normal daily activities, working out etc. Best to have one to wear and one to launder and then you can keep wearing a garment at all times immediate post opp. Arnica tablets and Arnica gel are great also drink plenty of water - flush out those toxins. Happy healing]]></description>
