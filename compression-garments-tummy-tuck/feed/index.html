		<description><![CDATA[4 weeks tummy tuck post op. Had a long night last night with a bit to much stretching and bending, so very swollen today! :/Can not wait to get into exercising and loosing the extra kilos I&#039;ve put on since surgery( I know swelling has a lot to do with it but I can just tell that due to lack of moving I&#039;ve gained some weight!) ! Still a million times better then before]]></description>
